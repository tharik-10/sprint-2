## Purpose
This document is to guide the setup of branch-specific notifications in a Version Control System (VCS) like GitHub, ensuring teams get real-time alerts for key events (e.g., push or pull request) on branches like `dev`, `main`, or `release`.

## Table of Contents

## Introduction 
VCS tools support branching workflows, but without targeted alerts, critical updates may be missed. This document outlines how to configure notifications for selected branches to improve collaboration and code visibility.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement            | Details                                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| VCS Admin Access       | Admin rights on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket  |
| Communication Tool     | Slack, Teams, Email, etc.                     |
| Webhook/Integration    | Valid webhook URL or bot setup                |
| Target Branches        | Branches like `dev`, `main`, etc.             |
| Hook Permissions       | Access to add/configure webhooks              |

## Conclusion

Branch-specific notifications improve team responsiveness and visibility into the development process. This setup ensures that stakeholders are only alerted for relevant events, reducing noise and focusing attention on high-priority branches.
