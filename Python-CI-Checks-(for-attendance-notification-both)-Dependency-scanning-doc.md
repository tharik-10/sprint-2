## Introduction
In modern software development, Continuous Integration (CI) is a critical practice that helps detect issues early, improve code quality, and speed up release cycles. For Python-based microservices such as the Attendance API and Notification-Worker in the OT-MICROSERVICES ecosystem, integrating CI with dependency scanning ensures secure, maintainable, and high-quality code.

## What is Python CI & Dependency Scanning?
- **Python CI**: Automates testing, linting, coverage analysis, and packaging of Python applications after every code change.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Identifies known vulnerabilities in project dependencies (libraries/packages) by analyzing requirements.txt, Pipfile.lock, etc.

## Why is it Important?
- Prevent security vulnerabilities from being deployed
- Ensure consistent build and deployment quality
- Maintain code standards
- Reduce technical debt early in the development lifecycle

## Different Tools used for Dependency Scanning
| **Tool**                   | **What It Does**                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Snyk**                   | Cloud tool that checks your Python packages for known security issues. Works well with GitHub, Jenkins, and even your code editor (IDE).               |
| **Safety CLI**             | Simple command-line tool that quickly checks your `requirements.txt` for vulnerabilities. Fast and great for local use.                                |
| **pip-audit**              | Official tool from Pythonâ€™s core team. Scans your project for known issues using a trusted database. Very accurate and easy to use.                    |
| **OWASP Dependency-Check** | Scans projects in many languages (not just Python) using the official NVD database. Powerful, but a bit harder to set up and use for Python-only apps. |
| **GitHub Dependabot**      | Built into GitHub. It automatically finds and fixes unsafe packages in your project by creating pull requests. No setup required!                      |
| **Poetry Audit Plugin**    | Adds security scanning to projects using `poetry`. Best if you manage dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.                                                |
